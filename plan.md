# Building a (fake) NFT online marketplace with JS and AI

## Goal

Demonstrate the concepts in JS1 through a practical (and hopefully fun) session.

### Topics

- JSON
- DOM Manipulation - innerHTML vs createElement vs template
- Functions - (default) arguments, returns, arrows
- Array methods - forEach, map, reduce, find, filter
- Events - Submit, Click
- Data attributes - data-id
- Truthy/Falsy
- Query Strings

## Project Anatomy

- Project structure
- What is `src`?
- What is `package.json`?
- What is `backend.js`

## Plan

- Delete all the files and start again
